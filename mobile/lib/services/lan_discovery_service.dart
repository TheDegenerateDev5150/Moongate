/// Companion to the Pi-side Avahi service file installed by v0.4.4+ (see
/// `docs/v0.5-lan-discovery-design.md` §6). Browses for `_moongate._tcp.local`
/// services, extracts each one's `printer_id` from the TXT records, and
/// keeps a `printerId → "http://host[:port]"` map. The status and control
/// services consult this map at the top of every LAN-bound call; when an
/// entry is present, the discovered URL takes precedence over the
/// persisted `lanUrl` so an IP change is recovered without needing a
/// tunnel-side round-trip.
///
/// Stateless across cold launches — the map is in-memory only. On launch
/// the persisted `lanUrl` from `PrinterRegistry` covers us until the first
/// browse populates the map (~500 ms on a typical home network).
