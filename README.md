# Moongate

> One app. Your Klipper printer. Anywhere.

Moongate is a free, open-source Android app that gives you a **full remote control interface for your Klipper 3D printer** — live webcam, print controls, temperatures, and the complete Mainsail UI — over your local network and automatically over the internet when you're away from home. No Tailscale. No VPN setup. No subscriptions.

## What it does

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | See all your printers at a glance — live webcam thumbnails refreshing every second, print progress, temperatures, and status |
| **Print controls** | Pause, resume, and stop prints directly from the dashboard tile. Stop requires a second press to confirm |
| **Firmware restart** | When a printer is idle or in error state, the stop button becomes a one-tap firmware restart |
| **Full Mainsail UI** | Tap any tile to open the complete Mainsail/Fluidd interface in an embedded browser |
| **Auto local/remote** | Connects over your home WiFi first; if unreachable, automatically falls back to the Cloudflare tunnel within 3 seconds |
| **Secure pairing** | One Klipper console command generates a time-limited QR + code. No port forwarding, no static IP |
| **In-app updates** | The app checks for new versions on launch and offers a one-tap download when one is available |

## How it works

```

The Moongate plugin runs inside Moonraker on your Pi. It handles pairing, token auth, status polling, and print control — proxying commands to Klipper on your behalf. A Cloudflare Quick Tunnel is started automatically on the Pi so you can reach it from anywhere without opening ports on your router.

---

## Setup

### Step 1 — Install the plugin on your Raspberry Pi

SSH into your Pi and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PEEKYPAUL/moongate/master/klipper-plugin/install.sh | bash
```

This will:
- Clone the Moongate repo to `~/moongate` and symlink the plugin into Moonraker
- Register Moongate with Moonraker's update manager (visible in Mainsail → Software Updates)
- Deploy the QR pairing page to Mainsail
- Install `cloudflared` and start the remote-access tunnel as a systemd service
- Restart Moonraker and Klipper

At the end you'll see output like:

```
  Updates   : Mainsail → Software Updates → Moongate
  Pairing   : http://192.168.1.x/moongate-pair.html
  Tunnel    : https://racing-partly-mouse.trycloudflare.com ✓
  Subdomain : racing-partly-mouse  (paste into app tunnel field)
```

> **Requirements:** Raspberry Pi running Klipper + Moonraker + Mainsail (standard Kiauh/MainsailOS setup). Tested on aarch64 (Pi 4/5) and armv7l (Pi 3).

> **Keeping it updated:** After the initial install, future plugin updates appear automatically in **Mainsail → Software Updates → Moongate** — no SSH needed.

---

### Step 2 — Install the app

[Download Moongate-v0.2.7.apk](https://github.com/PEEKYPAUL/Moongate/raw/master/APK/Moongate-v0.2.7.apk) and install it on your Android phone.

On first launch the app will ask you to add a printer.

---

### Step 3 — Pair

1. In Klipper/Mainsail, run the macro `MOONGATE_PAIR` in the console
2. Open `http://<your-pi-ip>/moongate-pair.html` on your PC — a QR code will appear
3. In the Moongate app, tap **+** → **Scan QR** and point your camera at the QR code
4. Done — your printer appears in the dashboard

**No PC handy?** You can also type the code shown in the Klipper console (`GATE-XXXX-XXXX`) directly into the app.

---

### Step 4 — Uninstall Module

To completely remove Moongate from your Pi, SSH in and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PEEKYPAUL/moongate/master/klipper-plugin/uninstall.sh | bash
```

This removes:
- The `moongate-tunnel` systemd service
- The Moongate Moonraker plugin
- The `~/moongate` repository clone
- `~/.config/moongate` (tokens and secret key)
- The `[moongate]` and `[update_manager moongate]` entries from `moonraker.conf`
- The `MOONGATE_PAIR` macro from your Klipper config
- The `moongate-pair.html` page from Mainsail

`cloudflared` itself is left in place as it may be used by other services. To remove it too: `sudo apt remove cloudflared`

Don't forget to uninstall the Moongate app from your phone as well.

---

## Pairing the remote (Cloudflare) URL

The QR code from `moongate-pair.html` automatically includes both your local IP and the Cloudflare tunnel URL. When you scan it, the app stores both — it uses local when you're home and the tunnel when you're away.

If you installed before the remote URL was available, re-run `MOONGATE_PAIR` and re-scan to pick it up.

## Building from source

Requirements: Flutter 3.19+ (stable channel), Android SDK, JDK 17.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PEEKYPAUL/moongate.git
cd moongate/mobile
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
# APK: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Printer shows Offline**
- Check that Moonraker is running: `sudo systemctl status moonraker`
- Confirm the plugin loaded: look for `[moongate]` in Moonraker logs (`~/printer_data/logs/moonraker.log`)

**Remote tunnel not connecting**
- Check the tunnel service: `sudo systemctl status moongate-tunnel`
- View the tunnel log: `cat /run/moongate-tunnel.log`
- The tunnel URL changes on each Pi restart — the app fetches the latest URL automatically via the status endpoint, so no re-pairing is needed

**Webcam not showing**
- The app fetches snapshots from `/webcam/?action=snapshot` on your Pi
- Make sure your webcam is configured in Mainsail and that URL works in a browser

**App says "Could not reach printer"**
- The app tries local first, then remote; if both fail it shows an error
- Check your phone's WiFi when on home network
- Check the tunnel status when remote

**Camera not opening in the pairing screen**
- Grant camera permission when prompted, or go to Settings → Apps → Moongate → Permissions and enable Camera
- The QR scanner requires Android with CameraX support (Android 5.0+)
