# Moongate

> One app. Your Klipper printer. Anywhere.

Moongate is a free, open-source Android app that gives you a **full remote control interface for your Klipper 3D printer** — live webcam, print controls, temperatures, and the complete Mainsail/Fluidd UI — over your local network and automatically over the internet when you're away from home. No Tailscale. No VPN setup. No subscriptions.

```

The Moongate plugin runs inside Moonraker on your Pi. It handles pairing, token auth, status polling, and print control — proxying commands to Klipper on your behalf. A Cloudflare Quick Tunnel is started automatically on the Pi so you can reach it from anywhere without opening ports on your router.

---

## Setup

### Step 1 — Install the plugin on your Raspberry Pi

SSH into your Pi and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PEEKYPAUL/moongate/master/klipper-plugin/install.sh | bash
```

> **Non-standard HTTP port?** Stock KIAUH / MainsailOS serves Moonraker on port 80 — the installer's default. If your nginx is on a different port (e.g. port 80 is taken by another service, or you're running Moonraker on `8080`), tell the installer:
>
> ```bash
> # Piped install
> MOONGATE_PORT=8080 bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PEEKYPAUL/moongate/master/klipper-plugin/install.sh)"
>
> # Or locally:
> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PEEKYPAUL/moongate/master/klipper-plugin/install.sh -o install.sh
> bash install.sh --port 8080
> ```
>
> The cloudflared tunnel and the QR pair URL will both use that port. In the app's pair screen, the **Port** field next to the IP is the matching control — leave it blank for 80, fill it in if you used something else here.

This will:
- Clone the Moongate repo to `~/moongate` and symlink the plugin into Moonraker
- Register Moongate with Moonraker's update manager (visible in Mainsail → Software Updates)
- Deploy the QR pairing page to Mainsail
- Install `cloudflared` and start the remote-access tunnel as a systemd service
- Restart Moonraker and Klipper

At the end you'll see output like:

```
  Updates   : Mainsail → Software Updates → Moongate
  Pairing   : http://192.168.1.x/moongate-pair.html
  Tunnel    : https://racing-partly-mouse.trycloudflare.com ✓
  Subdomain : racing-partly-mouse  (paste into app tunnel field)
```

> **Requirements:** Raspberry Pi running Klipper + Moonraker + Mainsail or Fluidd (standard KIAUH / MainsailOS / FluiddPI setup). Tested on aarch64 (Pi 4/5) and armv7l (Pi 3).

> **Keeping it updated:** After the initial install, future plugin updates appear automatically in **Mainsail → Software Updates → Moongate** — no SSH needed.

---

### Step 2 — Install the app

**Current version: v0.2.27**

**[⬇ Download Moongate-v0.2.27.apk](https://github.com/PEEKYPAUL/Moongate/raw/master/APK/Moongate-v0.2.27.apk)** and install it on your Android phone.

> Android only for now. Tap the link above to download directly to your phone.
> Enable **Install from unknown sources** for your browser or file manager before installing.

All releases are in the [APK folder](https://github.com/PEEKYPAUL/Moongate/tree/master/APK).

On first launch the app will ask you to add a printer.

---

### Step 3 — Pair

1. In Klipper/Mainsail, run the macro `MOONGATE_PAIR` in the console
2. Open `http://<your-pi-ip>/moongate-pair.html` on your PC — a QR code will appear
3. In the Moongate app, tap **+** → **Scan QR** and point your camera at the QR code
4. Done — your printer appears in the dashboard

**No PC handy?** You can also type the code shown in the Klipper console (`GATE-XXXX-XXXX`) directly into the app.

> The QR code automatically includes both your local IP and the Cloudflare tunnel URL. The app stores both — it uses local when you're home and the tunnel when you're away. If you installed before the remote URL was available, re-run `MOONGATE_PAIR` and re-scan to pick it up.

---

### Step 4 — Uninstall

To completely remove Moongate from your Pi, SSH in and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PEEKYPAUL/moongate/master/klipper-plugin/uninstall.sh | bash
```

This removes:
- The `moongate-tunnel` systemd service
- The Moongate Moonraker plugin
- The `~/moongate` repository clone
- `~/.config/moongate` (tokens and secret key)
- The `[moongate]` and `[update_manager moongate]` entries from `moonraker.conf`
- The `MOONGATE_PAIR` macro from your Klipper config
- The `moongate-pair.html` page from Mainsail

`cloudflared` itself is left in place as it may be used by other services. To remove it too: `sudo apt remove cloudflared`

Don't forget to uninstall the Moongate app from your phone as well.

## Security

> Short version: there is **no Moongate cloud**, no account, no central server. The only parties involved in any request are your phone, Cloudflare (for the tunnel), and your Pi.
>
> **The full audit-grade write-up is in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** — threat model, JWT internals, key management, the WireGuard Phase 2 story, how to audit, how to report a vulnerability. The summary below is the README-length recap.

### Authentication

| Layer | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Token format** | HS256 JWT, signed with a 32-byte secret generated by `os.urandom(32)` at install time. Stored on the Pi at `~/.config/moongate/secret.key` (mode `0600`, owner-only). Never leaves the Pi. |
| **Signature check** | Constant-time HMAC comparison (`hmac.compare_digest`) — no timing-attack surface |
| **Token lifetime** | 30-day TTL by default, configurable per-token. Each device gets its own JWT, individually revocable via `/server/moongate/revoke` |
| **On the phone** | Stored via `flutter_secure_storage` which on Android backs onto the **Android Keystore** — the JWT is hardware-encrypted and isolated from other apps on the device |
| **Every API call** | Requires a valid `mg_token=...` parameter. The plugin rejects any request whose JWT signature doesn't verify, has expired, or matches a revoked `token_id` |

### Pairing

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **Code format** | `GATE-XXXX-XXXX` — 8 digits |
| **Code lifetime** | 10 minutes (configurable) |
| **Single-use** | Marked `used=true` the moment it's exchanged for a JWT |
| **Brute-force guard** | Max 5 attempts before the code is invalidated. With 10⁸ possible codes, a 10-minute window, and 5 attempts, an online guess succeeds with probability ≈ 5 × 10⁻⁸ |
| **QR pairing** | The QR embeds a pre-issued JWT *plus* the printer's local IP and tunnel URL. No phone-to-Pi network call is needed during pairing — works even when the phone is on a different network. The JWT in the QR is single-use and the QR URL is only displayed on screens you control (your Klipper console / your browser) |

### Transport

**Local (same Wi-Fi as the printer)**

- HTTP over your LAN — identical to how Mainsail and Moonraker themselves serve their UIs
- Anyone on your LAN can already reach Moonraker, so the JWT requirement adds *device-level* auth on top of the network you already trust
- This is the default for stock Klipper installs; Moongate does not change it

**Remote (anywhere else)**

- HTTPS via **Cloudflare Quick Tunnel** — `cloudflared` runs on your Pi as a systemd service (`moongate-tunnel`) and connects outbound to Cloudflare's edge over QUIC/HTTP3
- TLS is terminated at Cloudflare; the connection from Cloudflare to your Pi is also encrypted (cloudflared's outbound TLS)
- The tunnel URL is a random unguessable subdomain like `racing-partly-mouse-surprised.trycloudflare.com`
- ⚠️ **Important nuance**: the JWT protects Moongate's own endpoints (`/server/moongate/*`). The same tunnel **also** carries the full Mainsail UI and the rest of the Moonraker API, which are open by default. **If the tunnel URL leaks, anyone with it can drive your printer through Mainsail without needing a JWT.** Bounded to the printer (no LAN pivot, no SSH), but on the printer it's effectively full control. See [SECURITY.md → URL leakage](SECURITY.md#what-does-url-leakage-actually-expose) for the full breakdown and the mitigations (Cloudflare Access is the recommended one — free, edge-side auth)
- Cloudflare can see the request metadata (it's their tunnel). Moongate makes no claim to hide your traffic *from Cloudflare*; you're trusting them the same way you'd trust your ISP. If that's not acceptable for your threat model, run a self-hosted tunnel instead (the install script's `cloudflared` step is the only piece that needs swapping)

### About the "VPN"

To be precise: **Moongate's remote access is currently a Cloudflare HTTPS tunnel, not a VPN**. The app does not route any of your phone's traffic through the printer. Your other apps (browser, social media, etc.) are completely unaffected when Moongate is running.

The repo does contain a partially-implemented **WireGuard** mode (Phase 2) — the Pi-side peer manager is functional, but the Android side ships as a stub that doesn't actually establish a tunnel yet. The WireGuard service icon you may see on Android is from that stub registering itself; no network traffic is routed through it. The current shipping remote-access path is **Cloudflare tunnel, HTTPS only**.

### What this defends against

- ✅ A stranger guessing the tunnel URL and trying Moongate's endpoints → blocked by JWT (but they can still hit Mainsail underneath — see the ⚠️ above)
- ✅ A pairing code being seen briefly on a screen → 10 min, 5 attempts, single-use
- ✅ Another app on your phone reading the JWT → Android Keystore
- ✅ Lost or stolen phone → revoke its specific token, every other device keeps working
- ✅ Replay attack with an intercepted JWT → revocation works immediately

### What this does *not* defend against

- ❌ A compromised Pi (the secret key lives there; if the Pi is rooted, all bets are off)
- ❌ A compromised, unlocked phone — Android Keystore stops other apps reading the token, not a malicious app running with your permissions
- ❌ Cloudflare itself being compromised or compelled (the tunnel ToS apply — see threat-model note above)
- ❌ HTTP traffic being sniffed on your LAN (this is the default Moonraker setup; if you need LAN encryption, put Moonraker behind nginx + TLS — outside Moongate's scope)
- ❌ Misconfigured Klipper running services on the open internet (don't port-forward port 80/7125 — the whole point of the tunnel is that you don't need to)

### Code references

If you want to verify any of the above:

- JWT signing/verification: [`klipper-plugin/moongate_standalone.py`](klipper-plugin/moongate_standalone.py) → `AuthManager._sign_token` / `_verify_token`
- Pairing-code lifecycle: same file → `AuthManager.generate_pair_code` / `exchange_code`
- Phone-side secure storage: [`mobile/lib/services/auth_service.dart`](mobile/lib/services/auth_service.dart) — uses `flutter_secure_storage`
- Cloudflare tunnel systemd unit: [`klipper-plugin/install.sh`](klipper-plugin/install.sh) → section 7 (`moongate-tunnel.service`)
- WireGuard stub status: [`mobile/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/moongate/app/MoongateVpnService.kt`](mobile/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/moongate/app/MoongateVpnService.kt)

## What it does

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Dashboard** | See all your printers at a glance — live webcam thumbnails refreshing every second, print progress (matched to Mainsail's slicer-time calculation), temperatures, chamber sensor, and status |
| **Print controls** | Pause, resume, and stop prints directly from the dashboard tile. Stop requires a second press to confirm. Idle / errored printers get a one-tap firmware-restart button |
| **Full Mainsail / Fluidd UI** | Tap any tile to open the complete web UI in an embedded browser. Auto-detects whichever you run |
| **Auto local / remote** | Connects over your home WiFi first; if unreachable, automatically falls back to the Cloudflare tunnel within 3 seconds. Remembers which path works per session |
| **Network-aware** | At cold launch and on every resume, the app checks the phone's subnet against each printer's. On a different network it skips the local probe entirely — no 3-second timeout, no chance of latching onto an unrelated device on a stranger LAN |
| **Secure pairing** | One Klipper console command generates a time-limited QR + code. JWT-based auth, no port forwarding, no static IP |
| **Auto-discovery** | Chamber temperature sensors are auto-detected regardless of how they're named in `printer.cfg` (`[temperature_sensor chamber]`, `[heater_generic CHAMBER]`, `[temperature_fan Chamber_Temp]`, etc.) |
| **In-app updates** | The app checks for new versions on launch and offers a one-tap download when one is available |
| **Customisable** | System / Light / Dark / **Custom** themes (the Custom mode lets you pick HEX values for accent, page background, cards, text and error from a colour editor with a 24-swatch palette), 1–3 column dashboard grid, font scale slider, optional landscape rotation |
| **Import / export** | One-tap config backup to clipboard; restore after a reinstall |

## Troubleshooting

**Printer shows Offline**
- Check that Moonraker is running: `sudo systemctl status moonraker`
- Confirm the plugin loaded: look for `[moongate]` in Moonraker logs (`~/printer_data/logs/moonraker.log`)

**Remote tunnel not connecting**
- Check the tunnel service: `sudo systemctl status moongate-tunnel`
- View the tunnel log: `cat /run/moongate-tunnel.log`
- The tunnel URL changes on each Pi restart — the app fetches the latest URL automatically via the status endpoint, so no re-pairing is needed

**Webcam not showing**
- The app fetches snapshots from `/webcam/?action=snapshot` on your Pi
- Make sure your webcam is configured in Mainsail and that URL works in a browser

**Dashboard tile shows the wrong printer when on a friend's network**
- Fixed in v0.2.18: the app now compares your phone's WiFi subnet against each printer's at cold launch and on resume. If they don't match it skips the local probe entirely and goes straight to the tunnel — no 3-second timeout, no false-positive from an unrelated device on the stranger LAN

**Camera error when scanning the QR code**
- Fixed in v0.2.19 (mobile_scanner bump) and v0.2.20 (ProGuard rules for ML Kit)
- Grant camera permission when prompted, or go to Settings → Apps → Moongate → Permissions and enable Camera

**Progress percentage on the tile doesn't match Mainsail**
- Fixed in v0.2.16: the app now uses `print_duration / estimated_time` from `/server/files/metadata` — the same formula Mainsail uses — instead of `display_status.progress` (which is 0 until the slicer emits `M73`) or `virtual_sdcard.progress` (which runs ahead of the toolhead due to look-ahead buffering)

## Changelog

| Version | Changes |
|---|---|
| **v0.2.27** | More reliable in-app update banner: (1) cache-buster on the `latest_version.json` fetch so GitHub's raw CDN can't serve a stale "no update" body, (2) re-run the update check every time the app comes back to the foreground so a user who had the app open before CI published a new release sees the banner appear without needing to force-close. Previously the FutureProvider's autoDispose cache could mask a freshly-published release for the entire session |
| **v0.2.26** | Auto-recover from "stuck on tunnel": once a printer's status service flipped to tunnel-first (e.g. one transient local-poll failure at startup), it would stay there for the rest of the session even after the user returned home and was sitting on the printer's LAN. The dashboard would keep saying "Tunnel" until the app was killed and reopened. Now every 20 seconds, if the phone's subnet matches the printer's, the service retries local-first for one cycle. If local succeeds it switches back; if not, the backoff prevents repeated 3 s timeouts |
| **v0.2.25** | Dashboard webcam refresh rate now mirrors the **Target FPS** you set in Crowsnest / Mainsail's webcam config. The plugin reads `target_fps` from `/server/webcams/list` and the tile derives its snapshot poll interval as `1000 / fps` ms — set Crowsnest to 15 fps, the tile ticks at 15 fps; set 30 fps, the tile ticks at 30 fps. Clamped server- and client-side to [1, 60]. Defaults to 15 fps when not configured (matches stock Crowsnest / mjpg-streamer). Persisted in `PrinterConfig` so the very first frame after cold-launch already uses the right cadence |
| **v0.2.24** | Dashboard webcam tiles bumped to 20 fps (now superseded by v0.2.25's server-driven rate) |
| **v0.2.23** | Custom-theme colour picker: the **Done** button now respects the system navigation / gesture bar at the bottom of the modal sheet. Previously the button could overlap the phone's 3-button nav row on devices using on-screen buttons |
| **v0.2.22** | Configurable HTTP port: `install.sh --port N` (also `MOONGATE_PORT` env var for piped installs); plugin reads the port from `~/.config/moongate/config.json` and embeds it in the QR + pair-page URLs; app's pair screen gains an optional **Port** field next to the IP for users with non-standard nginx setups. Plus: clarify in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and the README that the tunnel exposes Mainsail / Moonraker themselves, not just Moongate's JWT-protected endpoints — and how to mitigate (Cloudflare Access, tightened `trusted_clients`, or staying LAN-only) |
| **v0.2.21** | Custom theme: new fourth radio option in the drawer (System / Dark / Light / **Custom**) opens a full-screen colour editor. Five slots — Accent, Page background, Cards & tiles, Text, Error — each tappable to a modal sheet with HEX input + 24-colour preset palette. Live preview tile inside the editor, instant theme application across the app, reset-to-defaults action |
| **v0.2.20** | Camera scanner fix #2: add ProGuard rules for ML Kit + mobile_scanner so R8 doesn't strip the bundled barcode scanner classes (the mobile_scanner consumer rule had a single-dot wildcard bug that only matched the root package) |
| **v0.2.19** | Upgrade `mobile_scanner` 5.2.3 → 7.x — fixes the Samsung One UI `analysis.resolutionInfo!!` NPE. CameraX bumped to 1.5.3 |
| **v0.2.18** | Network-aware connection: subnet check at cold launch & on app resume pre-decides "use tunnel" for any printer whose LAN isn't reachable from the current WiFi. Symmetric `onHttpError` handling in the printer WebView so a 4xx from an unrelated device on a stranger LAN doesn't trigger the error overlay |
| **v0.2.17** | Printer screen now reads the dashboard tile's live network-path decision so tapping a tile on a foreign network jumps straight to the tunnel — no more "Printer unreachable" overlay |
| **v0.2.16** | Print progress now uses `print_duration / estimated_time` from `/server/files/metadata`, matching Mainsail/Fluidd exactly. Falls back to `display_status.progress` then `virtual_sdcard.progress` when slicer estimate is unavailable |
| **v0.2.15** | Supplementary progress query when the plugin endpoint omits `display_status` or `virtual_sdcard` |
| **v0.2.14** | QR scanner refactor: explicit `StreamSubscription` to `controller.barcodes` instead of `onDetect`, avoiding the `WidgetsBindingObserver` leak in `mobile_scanner` 5.x |
| **v0.2.13** | Force CameraX 1.4.0 to dodge a Samsung-specific NPE in `mobile_scanner` 5.x's CameraX 1.3.3 (later superseded by v0.2.19's package bump) |
| **v0.2.12** | Supplementary progress query, chamber sensor support refinements |
| **v0.2.11** | Chamber temperature on tile, supplementary chamber query for older plugin builds |
| **v0.2.10** | Silent offline retries + Mainsail/Fluidd webcam placeholder logo + grid column picker + Loading Local / Loading Tunnel / Offline labels in webcam area |
| **v0.2.9** | Always start local-first on launch; expand chamber discovery to include `temperature_fan` and `heater_generic` |
| **v0.2.8** | Dynamic chamber sensor discovery for any capitalisation / suffix |
| **v0.2.7** | Camera error diagnostic: show actual native error code/message so device-specific failures are readable |
| **v0.2.6** | Camera: explicit controller with autoStart=false + post-frame start; 700 ms delay on first permission grant |
| **v0.2.5** | Fix 5 bugs: app name capitalisation, import config crash, print controls now respect remote-first preference, router crash guard on missing printer, VPN disconnect safe on sign-out |
| **v0.2.4** | Fix camera `genericError` — switch `MainActivity` to `FlutterFragmentActivity` (required by CameraX / MobileScanner v5) |
| **v0.2.3** | Remove explicit `MobileScannerController` — let MobileScanner manage its own CameraX lifecycle |
| **v0.2.2** | Consistent release signing; fix update conflict on install; longer tunnel timeout (8 s); `startup` badge state |
| **v0.2.1** | In-app update banner; version bump process established |
| **v0.2.0** | Cloudflare Quick Tunnel remote access; auto local/remote fallback |
