# App Store submission — privacy answers and reviewer notes

Companion to `docs/privacy-policy.md`. This maps what the app actually does to
Apple's **App Privacy** questionnaire in App Store Connect, plus the **review
notes** to head off rejections. Grounded in a code audit (see
`diagnostics_service.dart`, `supabase_service.dart`, the Supabase functions, and
the dependency list — no analytics/ads/tracking SDKs are present).

## Key facts that shape the answers

- Sign-in is **anonymous** (a random UUID); no name/email/password.
- The **only** data sent off-device that contains device/network details is the
  **opt-in bug report** — nothing is transmitted unless the user taps Submit.
- There are **no analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs**. Nothing is used to
  track across apps/sites → **no App Tracking Transparency prompt is required**,
  and "Used to Track You" is **No** for every data type.
- "Collect" (Apple's meaning) = transmitted off the device. On-device-only
  items (settings, app-lock PIN hash, biometrics, the QR camera, custom
  background image) are **not** "collected".

## App Privacy questionnaire — recommended answers

Mark these as **Collected**, **Linked to the user** (everything ties to the
anonymous account id), **Not used for tracking**:

| Data type (Apple category) | What it is | Purpose | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identifiers → User ID | the anonymous account UUID | App Functionality | always |
| Identifiers → Device ID | the iOS push (APNs) token | App Functionality (notifications) | only if notifications enabled |
| Contact Info → Email Address | the optional "contact" field in a bug report | App Functionality / Support | only if the user types one |
| User Content → Customer Support | the bug-report comment text | App Functionality / Support | only if a report is sent |
| Diagnostics → Other Diagnostic Data | device model/OS, app version, local network addresses, printer connection diagnostics in a bug report | App Functionality / Support | only if a report is sent |
| Other Data | printer names and their local addresses (setup + bug reports) | App Functionality | setup; and in a report |

Everything else → **Not Collected**: Health, Financial, Precise/Coarse
Location, Sensitive Info, Contacts, Browsing/Search History, Purchases, Usage
Data (no analytics), Audio, Photos, etc.

### Note on IP address
Apple's questionnaire has no explicit "IP address" type. Our providers
(Supabase/Cloudflare) log IPs **only** for security, abuse-prevention, and
operations. Data collected solely for those purposes is exempt from the
"collected" disclosure, so it is **not** declared as a collected data type — but
it **is** disclosed in the privacy policy (section 1.5) for transparency.

## Account deletion (Guideline 5.1.1(v)) — DECISION NEEDED

Apps that "support account creation" must offer in-app account/data deletion.
Moongate creates an **anonymous** backend account, which is a grey area, but
review can be strict. Today, data is removed by deleting printers + uninstalling
(the anonymous identity is then auto-cleaned after inactivity).

**Recommendation (low risk path):** add a simple in-app **"Delete my data"**
action that deletes the current anonymous user's records (printers, push tokens)
and clears the local session. It is a small, self-contained feature and removes
this as a possible rejection reason. Decide before submission.

## Reviewer notes (paste into App Review Information → Notes)

> Moongate is a self-hosted 3D-printer dashboard. It connects to the user's own
> Raspberry Pi running Klipper/Moonraker.
>
> - **Sign-in is anonymous** — no account, email, or password. An anonymous id
>   is created automatically so the user's own printers can be associated with
>   their install.
> - **Local Network** permission is used to discover (Bonjour/mDNS,
>   `_moongate._tcp`) and connect directly to the user's printer on their Wi-Fi.
>   Without it, only the remote (tunnel) path works.
> - **Camera** is used only to scan the pairing QR code.
> - **Notifications** are opt-in and report the user's own print status.
> - No analytics, advertising, or tracking. No data is sold or shared for third-
>   party purposes.
> - **Hardware note:** the app controls a physical Klipper/Moonraker 3D printer,
>   so it can't be fully exercised without one. A short screen recording showing
>   pairing (QR scan) and the live dashboard is provided here: [DEMO VIDEO URL].
>   The App Store screenshots also show the main flows. We're happy to provide
>   anything else the review needs.

## Still to do before submission
- [x] **Privacy policy hosted** — live at https://peekypaul.github.io/Moongate/privacy-policy.html (GitHub Pages, master `/docs`).
- [x] **Policy placeholders filled** — controller = Moongate, contact = psychoshaft@live.co.uk, effective 26 June 2026.
- [x] **In-app "Delete my data"** — built + merged (#146); `delete-account` function deletes the anon user, cascades wipe the rest.
- [ ] Put the policy URL in **App Store Connect** (App Privacy → Privacy Policy URL) and link it from the README.
- [ ] Record a short **demo video** (pairing + dashboard) for the reviewer and drop its URL into the reviewer notes above (the app needs real hardware).
- [ ] Confirm the **retention periods** in the policy against the live cleanup cron.
- [ ] Deploy the Supabase functions (`register-push-token`, `send-push`, `delete-account`) + apply the push-token migration.
- [ ] Enrol the **$99 Apple Developer Program** (gates push delivery, TestFlight, and submission).
