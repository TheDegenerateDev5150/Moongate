-- Moongate v0.4.2 - Optional pi_public_key in claim_printer for manual
-- code entry as a camera-failure fallback.
--
-- v0.3 removed manual pair-code entry from the app on the basis that the
-- QR carried everything (version, pubkey, token) in one scan. The Pi
-- still emits the same human-typeable code via M118 ("MOONGATE CODE:
-- GATE-XXXX-XXXX") - the original intent was that it could be typed if
-- the camera was unavailable. This migration makes that path possible
-- again by allowing the claim to proceed without a pubkey in the
-- request.
--
-- Security analysis (why this is safe to relax):
--   • The token itself is the access secret (10-min TTL, single-use,
--     server-bound to a pi_public_key in enrollment_tokens at
--     enroll-prepare time).
--   • The pubkey from the QR was a defense-in-depth match against the
--     server's stored pubkey - not a separate auth factor. An attacker
--     who has the token already knows everything they'd need; an
--     attacker who lacks the token can't supply a valid pubkey either
--     (claim still fails on the token lookup).
--   • The server still uses enrollment_tokens.pi_public_key as the
--     authoritative key to bind the new printers row, so a malicious
--     client can't claim the wrong Pi by lying about the pubkey.
--
-- When the caller DOES supply a pubkey (the QR-scan path remains the
-- happy default), we still cross-check it against the server-side
-- value as before, so the existing path is byte-for-byte unchanged.
